## Current Status: 62% Ready (Designing)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete CEO interview** (in progress)
   - Answer 12 critical questions to establish baseline beliefs
   - Calculate fair value based on answers
   - Run sensitivity analysis

2. **Identify top 10 high-impact questions**
   - Questions that move valuation >$3/share
   - Focus V3 on these critical drivers

3. **Build V3 with analyst-grade questions**
   - Keep 23 good questions from V2
   - Fix 3 failures (future predictions → current reality)
   - Add 10 critical missing questions:
     - Organic vs promotional growth
     - Uber One subscription metrics
