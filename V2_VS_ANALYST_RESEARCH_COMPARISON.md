|------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **How much did Uber spend on share buybacks last quarter?** | **Thus far in Q4, how many shares have you repurchased?** | ⚠️ V2 asks about **last quarter** (Q3, already disclosed). Analyst asks **current quarter** (Q4, not yet disclosed). |
| **What is quarterly capex run rate right now?** | **Is the level of capital expenditure or R&D spend this quarter significantly different from prior run-rates?** | ✅ Good - both ask current spend |

### Other Critical Questions Missing from V2

The analyst research includes several questions that **don't appear in V2 at all**:

1. **Uber One subscription metrics:**
   - "What is the current Uber One subscriber count, and how has it changed?"
   - "What is the usage or retention rate of Uber One members?"
   - ⭐ **CRITICAL** - subscription revenue is high quality, recurring

2. **Product mix in Delivery:**
   - "In Delivery, what categories are growing fastest — restaurant vs groceries?"
   - "How do their unit economics compare?"
   - ⭐ **IMPORTANT** - grocery has lower margins

3. **Driver supply and incentives:**
   - "How is the driver supply trending this quarter?"
   - "Are you finding it necessary to increase driver incentives to meet demand?"
   - ⭐ **CRITICAL** - driver pay is biggest cost

4. **Real-time dashboard metrics:**
   - "What real-time dashboard metrics do you monitor most closely?"
   - "Any notable changes (wait times, surge frequency, driver online hours)?"
   - ⭐ **INSIGHTFUL** - reveals what management watches

5. **Cash flow timing:**
   - "Any changes in how fast you're collecting from customers or paying drivers?"
   - ⭐ **IMPORTANT** - reveals if FCF is temporarily inflated

6. **Current quarter visibility:**
   - "How would you characterize the visibility into next quarter's demand?"
   - ⭐ **VALUABLE** - forward-looking but based on current bookings

7. **What keeps you up at night:**
   - "As of today, what is your biggest concern or focus?"
   - ⭐ **GOLD** - open-ended, reveals hidden risks

## Summary: V2 Strengths

✅ **Strong coverage:**
- Unit economics (take rates, contribution margins)
- Stock-based comp (critical cost often ignored)
- Regulatory liabilities (quantified exposure)
- Advertising revenue (high-margin segment)
- Autonomous vehicle penetration (future margin driver)

✅ **Good specificity:**
- Asks for "ACTUAL" rates after incentives
- Quantifies multi-homing (competitive moat)
- Separates international vs US margins

---

## Summary: V2 Weaknesses

❌ **Violates "current reality only" rule:**
- "What WILL adjusted EBITDA margin be THIS quarter?" — Q4 hasn't ended yet, this is a **future prediction**
- "What is TRUE profit margin THIS quarter?" — Same issue
- **FIX:** Change to "What WAS adjusted EBITDA margin LAST QUARTER?" (testable against disclosed data)

❌ **Missing growth quality questions:**
- No question about **organic vs promotional growth**
- No **cohort retention** (e.g., "Of users acquired 6 months ago, what % are still active?")
- No **product mix** questions (UberX vs Pool, restaurant vs grocery)

❌ **Static vs. directional metrics:**
- Asks "What IS market share?" but not "Are you gaining or losing share?"
- Asks "What IS revenue?" but not "Of this growth, what % is organic vs incentivized?"

❌ **Missing critical areas:**
- **Uber One** (subscription program) — zero questions
- **Driver supply trends** — asks churn but not if supply is tight (forcing higher pay)
- **Product mix** — no questions on UberX vs Pool, restaurant vs grocery
- **Real-time operational metrics** — what does management actually watch daily?
- **Cash flow timing** — is current FCF sustainable or boosted by timing?
- **Open-ended risk question** — "What keeps you up at night?"

❌ **Asks about past (already public) instead of current:**
- "How much did Uber spend on buybacks **last quarter**?" — Already disclosed in Q3 10-Q
- **FIX:** "How much have you spent on buybacks **this quarter to date**?" — Q4 hasn't been disclosed yet

---

## Recommendations for V3

### Tier 1: Fix Critical Flaws (Must Do)

1. **Remove future predictions:**
   - ❌ Delete: "What WILL EBITDA margin be THIS quarter?"
   - ✅ Replace: "What WAS EBITDA margin LAST QUARTER (before public disclosure)?"
   - OR: "Based on October/November performance, is EBITDA margin tracking higher or lower than Q3?"

2. **Add organic vs bought growth:**
   - ⭐ "Of Q4's gross bookings growth, what % is from organic usage vs promotions/incentives?"
   - ⭐ "Are you seeing higher engagement per user, or is growth mainly from acquiring new users with incentives?"

3. **Add Uber One questions:**
   - ⭐ "What is the current Uber One subscriber count, and how has it changed this quarter?"
   - ⭐ "What is the retention rate of Uber One members, and do they take more trips than non-members?"

4. **Add driver supply question:**
   - ⭐ "How is driver supply trending this quarter? Are you increasing driver incentives to meet demand?"

5. **Add cohort retention:**
   - ⭐ "Of users who joined 6 months ago, what % are still active today on a monthly basis?"

### Tier 2: Add Missing Insights (Should Do)

6. **Add product mix:**
   - "Within Mobility, are you seeing shifts toward UberX vs Pool vs premium? How does this affect margins?"
   - "In Delivery, what % is restaurant vs grocery, and how are their unit economics different?"

7. **Add directional competitive questions:**
   - "In the past 3 months, are you gaining or losing market share in rideshare? In delivery?"
   - "Has Lyft or DoorDash become more aggressive on pricing or driver incentives?"

8. **Add real-time operational metrics:**
   - "What dashboard metrics do you monitor daily (wait times, surge, driver hours)? Any notable changes vs last quarter?"

9. **Add cash flow timing:**
   - "Any changes in how fast you're collecting from customers or paying drivers/restaurants?"

10. **Add open-ended risk:**
    - "As of today, what is your biggest concern or focus area for the business?"

### Tier 3: Nice to Have (Optional)

11. Update buyback question to ask about **current quarter** instead of last quarter
12. Update market share questions to ask **direction** (gaining/losing) not just current level
13. Add near-term visibility: "How would you characterize visibility into Q1 demand based on what you see now?"

| **TOTAL** | 30 | 23 | 3 | ~10 |

**Pass Rate: 77% (23/30)**

**Critical Fixes Needed: 3 questions fail framework**

**Critical Gaps: ~10 important questions missing**

## Bottom Line

V2 is **solid but not research-grade**. It:
- ✅ Covers most major areas
- ✅ Asks for "actual" numbers after incentives (good)
- ✅ Includes critical costs like SBC
- ❌ **Violates "current only" rule** (asks about Q4 before Q4 ends)
- ❌ **Misses growth quality** (organic vs bought)
- ❌ **Misses Uber One** (subscription revenue)
- ❌ **Misses driver supply trends** (cost pressure indicator)
- ❌ **Misses cohort retention** (growth sustainability)

**For V3:** Fix the 3 failures + add the 5-10 critical missing questions → would be **research-grade**.
